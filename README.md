# Engineering Intelligent Bioinformatics Pipelines  
## A 100-Day Systems Architecture Initiative

This project explores how biological systems inspire the design of scalable, reproducible, and intelligent computational pipelines.

The goal is to engineer workflow architectures that integrate bioinformatics, sensing principles, and on-chip learning concepts.

## Vision

Biological systems are sensing engines.

They:
- Detect signals  
- Process information  
- Adapt to stress  
- Maintain robustness  

Modern silicon systems do the same:
- Sensors collect signals  
- Circuits process them  
- Learning models adapt  
- Firmware ensures stability  

This project builds workflow systems that reflect that architecture.
