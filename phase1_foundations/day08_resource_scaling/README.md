# Day 08 – Resource Configuration & Scaling

## Objective

Separate computational resource configuration from workflow logic.

---

## Technical Concept

- Introduced process labels
- Configured resources in nextflow.config
- Decoupled logic from compute allocation

---

## Biological Analogy

Different cellular processes consume different energy levels.

Workflows should assign compute resources accordingly.

---

## Run

nextflow run main.nf
