# Day 13 – Advanced Channel Operators

## Objective

Implement metadata-aware grouping using advanced channel operators.

---

## Technical Concept

- Used `map()` to attach metadata
- Applied `groupTuple()` for grouping
- Demonstrated condition-based data structuring
- Prepared groundwork for differential analysis workflows

---

## Biological Analogy

Signals are grouped and processed according to receptor type.

Workflows must group samples by biological condition.
