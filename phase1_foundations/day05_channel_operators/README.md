# Day 05 – Channel Operators: Signal Filtering

## Objective

Explore channel operators:
- map
- filter
- collect

These enable transformation and selection of data streams.

---

## Technical Concept

1. Read expression data
2. Convert lines into structured tuples
3. Filter based on threshold (>40)
4. Format selected genes

---

## Biological Analogy

Cells respond only to strong signals.

Signal strength determines activation.

Channel filtering mimics biological signal selection.

## Run

```bash
nextflow run main.nf
```
