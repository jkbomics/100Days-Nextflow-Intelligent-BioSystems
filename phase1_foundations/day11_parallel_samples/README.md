# Day 11 – Parallel Multi-Sample Execution

## Objective

Process multiple input files in parallel using channel emission.

---

## Technical Concept

- Used wildcard path emission
- Enabled scatter execution
- Each input file triggered independent task
- Observed parallel execution via timeline report

---

## Biological Analogy

Cells respond to multiple signals simultaneously.

Workflow systems should process multiple data inputs concurrently.

## Run

nextflow run main.nf
